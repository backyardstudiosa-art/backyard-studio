      <p>
        Backyard Studio was born from a personal journey — one that required slowing down,
        listening inward, and finding new ways to express what words alone could not hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        After surviving a stroke, creativity became more than expression; it became a way back
        to myself. Writing, visual storytelling, and reflection helped me process change, faith,
        loss, and renewal. Over time, those private practices grew into something I could offer
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        This studio exists for people who want to honour their memories gently — without
        pressure, perfection, or noise.

      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>memories deserve care</li>
        <li>creativity can be restorative</li>
        <li>reflection helps us heal and understand</li>
        <li>stories don’t need to be loud to be meaningful</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Backyard Studio is not about fast results or polished performances. It’s about holding
        space — visually, creatively, and emotionally — for what matters to you.

      <h2 class="handwritten">How I Work</h2>
      <p>My approach is slow and intentional.</p>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>soft colours</li>
        <li>simple layouts</li>
        <li>thoughtful pacing</li>
        <li>emotional clarity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether I’m designing a scrapbook page or creating a reflective resource, the goal is
        always the same: to help your story feel seen, held, and honoured.
