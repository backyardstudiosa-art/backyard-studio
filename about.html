      <p>
        Backyard Studio grew out of a season that required slowing down, reflecting, and finding new ways to express what words alone could not always hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        After surviving a stroke, creativity became more than expression — it became a way back to myself. Writing, memory-keeping, and visual storytelling helped me process change, faith, loss, and renewal. What started as a personal practice slowly grew into something I could share with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        This studio exists for people who want to preserve their memories gently — without pressure, perfection, or noise.

      <h2 class="handwritten">What I Believe</h2>
      <p>I believe that:</p>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>memories matter</li>
        <li>creativity can be healing</li>
        <li>reflection helps us understand our journey</li>
        <li>stories don’t need to be loud to be meaningful</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Backyard Studio is not about rushing or over-producing. It’s about creating with care and intention.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section soft-background fade-in">
      <h2 class="handwritten">How I Work</h2>
      <p>My approach is calm and thoughtful.</p>
      <ul class="service-list">
        <li>soft colours</li>
        <li>simple, uncluttered layouts</li>
        <li>steady pacing</li>
        <li>emotional clarity</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether I’m creating a memory album or a reflective resource, the goal is always the same — to help your story feel seen and honoured.
