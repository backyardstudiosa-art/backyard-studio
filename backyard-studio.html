    <p>
      Backyard Studio is the creative arm of this ecosystem. It is a place where
      stories, memories, and ideas are shaped with calm intention, allowing creativity
      to become a grounding force rather than a demand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each project is approached slowly, honouring the emotion and meaning behind it.
      Creativity here is not rushed or extracted. It is allowed to unfold naturally.
