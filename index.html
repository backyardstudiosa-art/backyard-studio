    <h3>About Backyard Studio</h3>
    <p>
      Backyard Studio is a quiet corner of the internet where memories,
      creativity, and inner growth are woven together with intention.
      Inspired by the rhythm of the ocean — steady, grounding, ever-renewing.
    </p>
  </section>

<section id="who-i-am" class="content-section">
  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
  <p>
    Backyard Studio is an extension of who I am and what I believe in: that creativity and healing are not separate paths, but ones that often walk hand in hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    I blend thoughtful design, storytelling, and gentle therapeutic practices to help individuals find balance, clarity, and meaning in both personal and professional lives. My work is rooted in the belief that creativity can restore, ground, and guide us back to ourselves when life feels fragmented.
  </p>
  <p>
    Backyard Studio was born from quiet seasons of healing and rediscovery. It is a place where calm meets creativity, where inspiration flows at a natural rhythm, and where growth is allowed to unfold without force or rush.
  </p>
  <p class="invitation">
    This is an invitation to create, to reflect, and to move forward with clarity and grace.

  <h2>Discover Your Inner Balance</h2>
  <h3>Transform through creativity and healing</h3>

  <p>
    Balance is not something we force into place. It forms when we learn where to rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Backyard Studio, transformation unfolds through creativity, reflection, and grace. This is a space shaped by the belief that healing does not come from striving harder, but from being anchored deeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not about becoming more. It is about returning to what already holds you.
